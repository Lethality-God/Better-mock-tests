Ever prepared for an objective-type exam and felt the mock tests were too much of a hassle ?
Well, here is the solution - Better mock tests.

This is a program where you can enter the answer for MCQ options in a test, and then check them, with the program providing analysis of your score, including correct and incorrect answers.

Instructions-

1.) The program will show you the question number, and you will have to type either A/B/C/D/E....

2.) If you wish to not answer a question, leave it blank

3.) Once you are done with the test, type 'Q' to exit

4.) Your responses will be saved in a text file by the name of the test you enter

5.) The options can be changed by entering 'CHANGE', followed by the question number, and then option

6.) Everything is case in-sensitive (Except the file name)

7.) If you save 2 files by the same name, the older file is replaced by the newer file

NOTE: YOU WILL NEED PYTHON TO RUN THIS PROGRAM
